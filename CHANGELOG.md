All notable changes to SMS Spam Shield are logged here. Format loosely follows
Keep-a-Changelog; timestamps are UTC.

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-07-04 — Close the client→server seam: dispatch-mode + anonymous reporter_id
- The app can now submit to the GitHub-Actions broker end-to-end (was a documented gap):
  - `crowd.rs`: `CrowdReport` gains `reporter_id` (anonymous per-install UUID) so the server can
    count DISTINCT reporters for consensus — without it every report was "anon" and could never
    reach threshold. `CrowdConfig.dispatch_event_type` + new `request_body()` wrap the POST as a
    GitHub `repository_dispatch` envelope `{event_type, client_payload}` when set (else the bare
    report); `submit_report` adds the GitHub `Accept`/`X-GitHub-Api-Version` headers in that mode.
    `build_report(text, sender, reporter_id, now)`. New test `request_body_bare_vs_dispatch_envelope`;
    `cargo test` → **68 lib pass** (10 crowd).
  - FFI (`mod.rs`): `SpamConfig.crowd_dispatch_event_type`; `spam_report_spam(text, sender,
    reporter_id)`. Re-generated the UniFFI Kotlin bindings and re-verified: `SpamConfig` = 16 fields
    incl. `crowdDispatchEventType`, `suspend fun spamReportSpam(text, sender, reporterId)`.
  - `SpamShield.kt`: `Config.crowdDispatchEventType`; `configure()` generates+persists an anonymous
    `reporter_id` (UUID in SharedPreferences, automatic — no per-boot step); `report()` sends it.
    Wiring re-verified against the regenerated bindings.
  - `server/README.md`: seam section replaced with the two supported submit paths (GitHub dispatch-
    mode built-in vs provider bare-endpoint). STILL UNVERIFIED: the live GitHub-Actions run + a real
    device/AAR build.

### 2026-07-04 — Crowd-feed SERVER: GitHub-Actions consensus broker (`server/`)
- Built the write-path "server" with **no host of ours** — GitHub Actions is the compute, the feed
  is a static file served via `raw.githubusercontent`:
  - `server/ingest.py` — the broker (pure stdlib). CONSENSUS baseline: a `content_fp` is held in
    `staging.json` and only promoted to `feed.json` after **N distinct `reporter_id`s** (default 3,
    env `CROWD_CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD`). Per-reporter dedup; anonymous reports collapse to a single
    `anon` vote so they can't reach the threshold alone; malformed fingerprints rejected (exit 3);
    promotion picks the most-reported sender number. Optional `CLASSIFY_CMD` re-classification gate
    (fail-closed) + optional attestation (verify in the workflow) — documented, off by default.
  - `.github/workflows/crowd-ingest.yml` — fires on `repository_dispatch: crowd-report`, writes the
    payload via env-indirection (no shell injection), runs `ingest.py`, commits the feed;
    `permissions: contents:write`, `concurrency` serializes ingests. `server/feed.json` (`[]`) +
    `server/staging.json` (`{}`) seeded.
  - `server/test_ingest.py` — 6 host tests (promote-at-threshold, dedup, anon-flood cap,
    malformed-reject, already-published no-op, threshold-2) → **all pass**.
  - `server/README.md` — deploy + client wiring + security model.
- **Honest seam flagged (not hand-waved):** the generic client POSTs a bare `CrowdReport`, but
  GitHub's dispatch API wants a `{event_type, client_payload}` envelope — so bridging needs a small
  client "dispatch-mode" or a provider endpoint (both server-free). Documented in `server/README.md`.
- STATUS: `ingest.py` logic host-tested; the **live GitHub-Actions run is UNVERIFIED** here (Actions
  runs on GitHub) — enable the workflow + send a test dispatch to exercise end-to-end.

### 2026-07-04 — Verify Kotlin facade wiring against the real generated bindings
- Generated the actual UniFFI Kotlin bindings (`cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen -- generate
  --library target/debug/libspam_shield.so --language kotlin`) and read them to confirm
  `SpamShield.kt` compiles/lines up — no device/AAR build needed for this. All facade
  assumptions match the generated code: package `uniffi.spam_shield`; top-level funcs;
  `suspend fun spamClassify(text, sender, isKnownContact): SpamVerdict` + suspend
  `spamReportSpam`/`spamRefreshFeeds`/`spamRefreshCrowd`; sync `spamConfigure`/`spamStatus`;
  15 camelCased `SpamConfig` fields; `SpamVerdict{score: UByte, matchedSource: String?}`;
  `SpamLevel { CLEAN, SUSPICIOUS, SPAM, SCAM }`; `SpamFeedKind { URLS, HOSTS }`;
  `SpamRefreshResult.ok`. Corrected the facade header (residuals RESOLVED, not "to confirm").
  Still unverified (would need a real build/run, not necessary to trust the detector): Gradle/AAR
  packaging + on-device runtime. Also corrected the earlier wrong "no Android build env" claim —
  the box has a full SDK at `/opt/android-sdk` (NDK/build-tools/adb/emulator) + cargo-ndk.

### 2026-07-04 — Public Kotlin `SpamShield` facade + drop-in docs + crowd-feed design
- **Core Android module (`android/spamshield/`, compile-UNVERIFIED — no Android env here):**
  - `SpamShield.kt` — the single public entry point (clean Kotlin facade over the UniFFI
    bindings): `configure(context, Config)` / `classify(sender, body, isKnownContact) → Verdict`
    / `report(sender, body)` / `refreshNow()` / `scheduleAutoRefresh(context)`. Hides the FFI
    record/enum shapes behind plain `Config`/`Verdict`/`Level`/`Feed` types; `Config` has
    privacy-first defaults (online + crowd OFF). Residuals to confirm at binding-gen time are
    listed in the file header (generated package/enum spelling, suspend mapping, .so+JNA).
  - `SpamRefreshWorker.kt` — WorkManager `CoroutineWorker` (12h, network-constrained, KEEP)
    → self-starting feed + crowd refresh, zero per-boot manual step.
  - `build.gradle.kts` (com.android.library, coroutines + work-runtime + JNA), `AndroidManifest.xml`
    (INTERNET/ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE), and `settings.gradle.kts` now includes `:spamshield`.
- **Engine:** threaded `trusted_senders` through the FFI — `SpamConfig.trusted_senders` →
  `HeuristicConfig` in `spam_classify`, so the host's never-flag allowlist is actually applied
  (was default-empty before). `cargo test` → 67 lib + 7 corpus pass.
- **Docs:** `docs/CROWD_FEED_DESIGN.md` (fingerprint model, GitHub-Actions-broker write path,
  Play Integrity/App Attest + N-reporter consensus, provider-hosted option). README gains a
  **Quick start** (the ~4-line drop-in) and a **Repository map** table for navigability.
- Navigability check: engine files are single-concern (extract/store/feeds/online/heuristic/
  crowd/engine/mod), 154–914 lines each (heuristic's size is ~half lexicons+tests) — not spaghetti.

### 2026-07-04 — Wire crowd feed + L0 heuristic into the FFI; styled-fp hardening
- **FFI wiring (`spam/mod.rs`):** `SpamConfig` gains `crowd_enabled/crowd_feed_url/
  crowd_report_url/crowd_auth_header_name/crowd_auth_header_value`; `spam_configure` builds the
  `CrowdConfig` and warms the crowd cache (`<cache>.crowd.json`). `spam_classify` now takes an
  `is_known_contact` flag and runs three fast offline signals before any network — **crowd-feed
  match → L0 political heuristic → threat-feed match** — first hit wins. This also fixes a known
  gap: the flagship `classify_political` heuristic was host-tested but had never been called by the
  FFI; it is now wired in (default HeuristicConfig; host-supplied trusted senders can be threaded
  later). New FFI fns `spam_report_spam(text,sender)` (builds+uploads a fingerprint, raw text
  never leaves the device) and `spam_refresh_crowd()` (downloads+installs+persists the feed;
  failure keeps the old feed). A saved contact is never flagged.
- **Fingerprint hardening:** `content_fingerprint` now normalizes via the heuristic's NFKC +
  zero-width stripper, so a styled-Unicode (`𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗲`) or zero-width-obfuscated copy of a campaign
  fingerprints identically to the plain copy (crowd feed catches styled rotations). New test
  `fingerprint_defeats_styled_and_zerowidth_evasion`; `heuristic::normalize` made `pub(crate)`.
- `cargo test` → **67 lib + 7 corpus pass, 0 warnings**; build clean. Live client↔server crowd
  exchange remains UNVERIFIED (no server in this env); the data model + wiring are host-tested.

### 2026-07-04 — Crowd-feed client scaffolding (`engine/src/spam/crowd.rs`)
- New self-contained module for an OPT-IN crowd-sourced spam feed — the structural answer to
  rotating numbers (a campaign only has to be caught ONCE by anyone, then every app matches it).
  - **Rotation-proof `content_fingerprint`**: normalizes the body (drops the greeting, links,
    opaque per-recipient codes / long digit runs, `<PLACEHOLDER>` tokens; strips punctuation)
    then FNV-1a hashes it — so the SAME campaign to different people, from different numbers,
    with different tracking links yields the SAME fingerprint (proven by `fingerprint_is_rotation_proof`).
    Never uploads raw text. Keeps the **sender number** as a separate field (per the product
    decision) as a bonus signal — matching keys on the content fp, so a rotated number never
    breaks the match.
  - `CrowdFeedStore` (JSON, load/save, O(1) set match) + `match_feed` (Spam on content hit,
    Suspicious on number-only hit) + `build_report`.
  - **Pluggable transport** `CrowdConfig{feed_url, report_url, auth_header_name/value}` +
    `fetch_feed`/`submit_report` (reqwest) — an SMS provider points it at their OWN server and
    adds an API-key/attestation header if they want. Anti-poisoning (server re-classify +
    N-reporter consensus + optional Play Integrity/App Attest) lives SERVER-side, not in the
    client — deliberately light here because poisoning a political-spam fp feed has little payoff.
  - 8 host tests (rotation-proof fp, content/number match, JSON round-trip, config gates,
    placeholder stripping) — `cargo test` → 66 passed. NOT yet wired into the FFI (`SpamConfig`/
    `spam_classify`/a `spam_report_spam` fn) — thin next step; live server exchange UNVERIFIED.

### 2026-07-04 — BASIC-script recall tune against the confirmed set (FP-safe)
- Used the 26-message LLM-confirmed political set (Haiku AND local gemma3 independently
  agreed on 26/175 — cross-validated) to raise L0 recall the disciplined way: broadened the
  ENGAGEMENT_CTA lexicon with real survey/poll CTA variants ("voter survey", "take my survey",
  "would you vote", "voter guide") and get-out-the-vote ACTION phrases ("request your absentee
  ballot", "vote by mail", "find your polling place", "register to vote", "have you voted");
  added `polling`/`governor`/`for congress|senate|president` to POLITICAL and `donor`/
  `end-of-quarter` to FUNDRAISING. These only flag WITH a second political signal (the ≥2-strong
  rule), and GOTV/ survey CTAs are near-zero-FP (banks/2FA/retail/delivery never say them). No
  sample-specific hardcoding (removed a couple of over-specific phrases that fit one sample).
- **Result:** recall on the 26 confirmed set **3/26 → 16/26 (~62%)**; IMC25 US catches **3 → 17**;
  and **false positives stayed 0 across 104,899 messages** (UCI 0/4,827, combined 0/53,396,
  Balanced 0/10,191, Mishra 0/5,971). 58 unit + corpus tests green; all clean controls hold.
  New `political_confirmed_recall` corpus test tracks it; the 10 remaining misses (single-category
  news/advocacy/urgency like "SCORCHED EARTH on the Trump indictment") are the AI-tier (L1) residual.

### 2026-07-04 — Recall audit (broad-net + LLM judge) + two-tier product decision
- **Method** (`tools/recall_audit.py`): to measure what the strict heuristic MISSES without
  hand-labelling thousands of texts, a deliberately BROAD keyword net over-selects candidates
  (175/1,492 US msgs, intentionally including false positives), then a small LLM (Haiku)
  adjudicates each as political-spam or not. NOT a blocklist — the LLM reads content and
  judges; the broad net is a measurement instrument, not the product detector.
- **Result:** Haiku confirmed **26/175 candidates are genuine political spam**, and **0/150**
  non-candidates were political (the keyword net itself misses ~none). The strict L0 heuristic
  caught only **3 of those 26 → ~12% recall**. The 23 misses are UNAMBIGUOUS political spam
  ("*OFFICIAL MESSAGE FROM PRES TRUMP* Would you vote…", "Rush $9 before I review our supporter
  list", "donate to my <party> campaign", NextGen CA voter surveys) — the conservative ≥2-strong
  rule is discarding them. Saved the 26 as `engine/tests/data/political_confirmed.txt` (gitignored;
  embeds IMC25 text) = the labeled political-spam recall set we previously lacked.
- **Decision (product tiering):** BASIC mode = the on-device script (free, zero-FP, catches the
  clear ones) — to be improved using the 26-msg recall set while re-verifying 0 FP on the ~58k ham.
  ADVANCED mode = opt-in AI (the two already-scaffolded backends: on-device Nano [free/private] or
  cloud [paid, off-device]) to "nail down everything," incl. the deliberately-vague texts. Next:
  raise BASIC recall against the confirmed set (FP-guarded); wire the tier toggle into the API.

### 2026-07-04 — US-only crowd-sourced corpus slice (IMC25) + detector run
- Added `imc25_us_political_flags` corpus test over a **US-only** slice of the 2025
  crowd-sourced smishing dataset (`reportsmishing/Smishing-Dataset-IMC25`, an IMC 2025
  paper mining public user reports). Filtered the 33.9k-row global set to rows whose
  reporting network was `original_network_country == USA` **and** `language == English`
  → **1,492 messages (2019–2023)**, US-by-construction and majority-English — the first
  slice that satisfies all of: post-2020-active, US-majority (100% US network), general
  (all smishing scam types), English. Staged as `tests/data/imc25_us.txt` (fetched/derived,
  not vendored). Rationale for filtering vs. using the raw set: the raw IMC25 is a *global*
  corpus (USA only 4.6% of identified networks; India 11%, NL/GB/ES/FR/AU dominate) so it
  fails the "not >50% foreign" rule — the US-network filter fixes that.
- **Detector result:** over the 1,492 US messages the L0 political detector flagged **3**,
  and all 3 are true political campaign/fundraising spam (a "Paid by …4Sheriff" GOTV text, a
  "donate to my campaign" ask, and a "Pres Trump … defend our Election from the Left" blast).
  It left the other 1,489 delivery/bank/refund smishing untouched — correct needle-in-haystack
  behavior for a political-specific detector, 0 obvious false positives on the flags.
- Added `winred_live_samples` test over **8 real 2024–2025 RNC/WinRed political-spam texts**
  scraped verbatim from the public ResourcesForLife archive (item41854/item42207) — the
  flagship rotating-number class no labelled dataset has. **Heuristic caught 1/8**: only the
  sample with explicit political+fundraising co-occurrence (GOP+donate+Trump). The other 7 are
  deliberately vague ("pitch in $25 to my next goal", "official party survey/question #3",
  "Justice Department just found…") and carry almost no keyword signal — catching them by
  keyword would break the zero-FP priority (they read like a friend/news). CONCLUSION: evasive
  political spam needs the semantic **AI layer** (L1), not more L0 keywords. Data staged at
  `tests/data/winred_live.txt` (WebFetch-extracted excerpts, may be partial).

### 2026-07-04 — Political-ENGAGEMENT signal (polls/petitions, not just donations)
- Added an `ENGAGEMENT_CTA` signal (sign-our-letter / petition / "who will you vote for" /
  take-our-poll / pledge-to-vote) as a strong category, so political spam that asks for
  ENGAGEMENT rather than money now flags (political + engagement = 2 signals). Kept
  political-specific so a "vote for your favorite flavor, reply to enter" contest and plain
  appointment/RSVP texts stay clean. NOTE: hardcoding the test sample's "-Titus" tag was
  removed (anti-cheat) — the Titus poll is caught by GENERAL signals ("plan to vote for" +
  Democrat/Republican).
- Result: ALL 6 confirmed real user samples now flag (4 fundraisers + poll + petition);
  **false positives still 0 across ~58,000 real ham**; corpus political catches 14 → 17;
  58 unit + 3 corpus tests green; no regressions.

### 2026-07-03 — Large-corpus baseline + name-based recall tune (FP-safe)
- Added `general_smishing_corpus_baseline` + `political_recall_estimate` tests over a
  **~84,863-message** consolidated general-spam/smishing corpus (GitHub
  `shaghayegh-hp/Smishing_Dataset`; fetched, not vendored). Combined with UCI, the detector
  now has **0 false positives across ~58,000 real ham messages**.
- **Recall tune:** the baseline surfaced that name-based political fundraising spam
  ("Trump … please contribute", "Speaker Pelosi …") slipped through because the political
  lexicon had only generic terms. Added US political figures / movements / committees
  (Trump/Biden/Pelosi/Kamala/MAGA/Patriot/NRCC/NRSC/…) to the `POLITICAL` lexicon →
  political catches on the corpus rose **6 → 14**, with **false positives still 0** on the
  ~58k ham.
- **Figure-name FP guardrail (proven):** a political NAME is only ONE strong signal, so the
  ≥2-strong rule means it can never flag alone — texting a friend about Trump/Biden/Pelosi
  (or a name + a casual "$20 pizza") stays clean; only *name + a fundraising ask* flags. New
  `figure_name_alone_is_clean` / `figure_name_plus_casual_money_is_clean` /
  `figure_name_plus_fundraising_is_spam` unit tests lock this in. `cargo test` → 57 unit +
  3 corpus, all pass.
- Broad `looks_political_broad` yardstick added to the corpus test ONLY as a measurement aid
  (not part of the product detector) to approximate political recall without hand-reading the
  corpus.

### 2026-07-03 — Real-corpus validation (UCI SMS Spam Collection)
- Added `engine/tests/corpus.rs` — runs the L0 political-spam heuristic over the full **UCI
  SMS Spam Collection** (5,574 real labelled SMS: 4,827 ham + 747 spam). **Result: 0 false
  positives on 4,827 real ham messages (0.00%)** — hard-validates the zero-false-positive
  priority against thousands of real legitimate texts (not synthetic). Flagged 0/747 general
  spam, which is EXPECTED/correct: UCI is 2005-era prize/ringtone spam, not political, and
  this detector is political-specific — so the corpus validates the false-positive side but
  not political recall. Dataset is fetched, not vendored (see `engine/tests/data/README.md`;
  test skips if absent). © Almeida & Gómez Hidalgo, redistributable with citation.

### 2026-07-03 — L1 AI layer: two independent AI backends (`android/spamshield-ai`)
- New Android library module with the optional AI classifier layer — **two separate,
  user-selectable backends** (not combined): `NanoAiClassifier` (on-device Gemini Nano via
  ML Kit GenAI Prompt API `com.google.mlkit:genai-prompt:1.0.0-beta2` — private, no key, zero
  app storage, Nano-capable devices only) and `CloudAiClassifier` (any OpenAI-compatible
  `/chat/completions` endpoint — works on any phone, needs key+network, content leaves device,
  opt-in). Shared `AiClassifier` interface + `AiVerdict` + `PoliticalSpamPrompt` (prompt encodes
  the diverse-topic political/donation definition + an explicit never-flag list for FP safety +
  tolerant JSON parsing). `classify()` returns null on any failure → caller falls back to the
  heuristic, never treats null as spam. Cloud uses only java.net + org.json (no extra deps).
- Gradle module scaffolding (AGP 8.5.2 / Kotlin 1.9.24 / compileSdk 34 / minSdk 26 / coroutines
  1.8.1). Doc: `docs/AI_LAYER.md`.
- STATUS: written against the documented APIs (surface read from the official ML Kit get-started,
  not guessed). **Compile + on-device UNVERIFIED** — the build sandbox has no working Android
  Gradle (system Gradle 4.4.1) and no Nano device. Residuals to confirm on-device are listed in
  `docs/AI_LAYER.md` (non-streaming response accessor; a couple of import sub-packages).

### 2026-07-03 — Evasion + link robustness (quick wins)
- **Zero-width strip** in `normalize()`: drops invisible format chars (ZWSP/ZWNJ/ZWJ/
  word-joiner/BOM/soft-hyphen, U+200B–U+200F, U+2060–U+2064, U+FEFF, U+00AD, …) before
  NFKC, so keyword evasion like `d‍o‌n​a⁠t﻿e` no longer slips past the lexicons. (Verified
  NFKC alone does NOT remove these.)
- **Scheme-less tracking links**: `has_tracking_link()` now scans raw whitespace tokens,
  catching the common SMS form `www.x.com/07011t1s2/lKBgJW` (previously only `http://`
  links were seen). Still excludes hyphenated slugs (e.g. `eventbrite.com/e/sunset-yoga`).
- 2 tests; `cargo test` → 54 pass, 0 warnings; no regressions.

### 2026-07-03 — Trusted-sender allowlist (anti-FP)
- **`HeuristicConfig.trusted_senders`** (new, default empty) + `sender_is_trusted()` /
  `digits_match()` in `heuristic.rs`: a host-supplied sender is never flagged as political
  spam regardless of content (mirrors `is_known_contact`). Matches case-insensitively for
  alphanumeric A2P sender IDs (e.g. "Eventbrite") or by digits for short codes / phone
  numbers (tolerant of a leading country code; short codes match exactly). Exempts the
  heuristic ONLY — phishing feed matches (L2/L3) still apply, so a spoofed/compromised
  trusted sender pushing a known-bad link is still caught. Closes the opted-in campaign-
  fundraiser-event-reminder false-positive edge. 4 tests; `cargo test` → 52 pass, 0 warnings.

### 2026-07-03 — L0 political-spam heuristic (step 2)
- **`engine/src/spam/heuristic.rs`** (new) — `classify_political(text, sender,
  is_known_contact, &HeuristicConfig) -> Option<Verdict>`: the flagship content-aware
  detector for unsolicited political campaign/fundraising texts (the rotating-number,
  "STOP-doesn't-stop-it" class that no reputation DB can catch). General signals only —
  fundraising + political/GOTV lexicons, survey CTA, FCC opt-out keywords (gate), "paid
  for by", per-recipient tracking shortlink, styled-Unicode evasion, ActBlue/WinRed/NGP
  fundraising domains, unknown-10-digit-P2P sender. NFKC-normalizes first to defeat
  "𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗵-𝗯𝗼𝗹𝗱" keyword evasion. Conservative decision rule (one weak signal never flags).
  Grounded in verified FCC rules + political-texting research + real-world sample
  messages — the samples are TEST FIXTURES only; the matcher hardcodes no spammer
  domain/number. Added dep `unicode-normalization 0.1`.
- `cargo test` → **11 heuristic tests + 23 reused = all pass**: 3 real samples flag via
  general signals; 4 clean controls (2FA / delivery / retail / personal) stay clean.
- Known gap (logged): tracking-link detection only sees `http://` links, not the common
  scheme-less `www.x.com/code`. Not yet wired into the FFI `spam_classify`. Status:
  host-tested; on-device UNVERIFIED.

### 2026-07-03 — False-positive hardening (precision-first)
- Reworked the L0 decision rule to flag ONLY on a fundraising-domain link OR ≥2
  independent STRONG signals {fundraising word, political, styled-Unicode, "paid for
  by"}. A bare money amount, opt-out wording, "reply YES", a shortlink, and an unknown
  sender are now boosters/reasons only — they never trigger a flag. Fixes two FP holes
  (retail "$20 off"; news link + one political word). Added realistic clean near-miss
  tests (2FA, appointment, bank alert, charity receipt, news link, contest, RSVP, retail;
  financial short-code notices: bank balance, Cash App payment, fraud/suspicious-activity
  alert, low balance; Eventbrite event reminders incl. a civic-named event) — 17 clean-
  control tests + 6 spam/recall. `cargo test` → 48 pass, 0 warnings.
- Trade-offs (intentional, per zero-FP priority): a pure GOTV text with no money/party/
  styled/tracking signal is not flagged; and an opted-in *campaign-fundraiser event*
  reminder (fundraising + political = 2 strong) would flag. Planned fix for legit bulk
  senders: a host-configurable trusted-sender allowlist (never flag Eventbrite / your
  bank / your subscriptions), alongside `is_known_contact`.

### 2026-07-03 — Project bootstrap + engine extraction (step 1)
- **Scoping + research** — decided the project: open-source (Apache-2.0) drop-in SMS
  spam-flagging library; flagship target = political spam; a compact, self-contained Rust
  engine core; pluggable local AI with **no bundled model** (on-device Gemini Nano via ML
  Kit GenAI, or developer cloud, or none). Verified local-AI feasibility (ONNX/Rust-on-
  Android, Gemini Nano is OS-owned = zero app storage, flagship-only today). See the README
  for the design.
- **`engine/` crate created** (`spam_shield` 0.1.0) — a standalone, self-contained UniFFI
  crate providing the offline detection layers (`extract`/`store`/`feeds`/`online`/`engine`/
  `mod`), with no messaging-app coupling.
  New `Cargo.toml` (minimal deps: once_cell, tokio, reqwest+rustls, url, serde/serde_json,
  log, uniffi 0.28) + `src/lib.rs` (`uniffi::setup_scaffolding!()` + `pub mod spam`).
  FFI surface unchanged: `spam_configure` / `spam_refresh_feeds` / `spam_classify` /
  `spam_status`. **`cargo test` → 23/23 host tests pass.** No Android build yet (no NDK
  run here); on-device classify UNVERIFIED.
- Added `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0, canonical text), `README.md`, `.gitignore`, this changelog.
